    "title": "I used to think tidying was moral",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve always struggled with tidying. Making my bed, gathering all the dirty clothes from the floor, loading the dishwasher and sanitizing the countertops—I struggle with all this to this day. But I feel better about it, and much more hopeful of finding a balance that works for me. Let me tell you why:\nI used to think tidying was a moral thing. Good people kept their spaces tidy, and the ones who didn’t were, by extension, bad people.\nIt was never spelled out like that. Instead, this dichotomy was enforced very effectively through shame and societal expectations. I felt ashamed of my messy spaces, and I felt like that shame was justified.1 Regardless of whether I wanted my room to be clean, it was clear that I should want it and that it should be clean. Jokes about Einstein having a messy desk were of limited help, because we all knew that in the real world people made their beds and why won’t you just do this one thing?2\nThe choices were few. I could ignore the issue, pretend I didn’t care. This was easy up to a point, because I often really don’t care. I will walk over piles of things to get to where I need to be and it won’t phase me in the least. I will make space just for my laptop on my messy desk and work just like that. But this state is never too long lasting, because things keep piling up, and with them so does the shame. So I pull out my next card, the “try” option. I try to organize. To clean. To put everything in its place and have a pristine space. Here I can either fail, only complete some partial cleaning, and feel bad; or I can succeed, maintain a clean state for a few hours or days, and then start to feel bad as it deteriorates again. Everyone wins!\nKC Davis changed the game. KC is the person behind StruggleCare.com, the TikTok channel DomesticBlisters, and much more. And this is what she has to say:\n\nMy first advice is to hear this sentence: Care tasks are morally neutral. They have nothing to do with being a good or bad person. We’re gonna stop thinking about whether something is good enough and we’re gonna start thinking about whether something functions in your home. And you are a person who deserves to function, even if you don’t like yourself.\n\n\n\nQuote from KC Davis on the Infinite Quest Podcast’s March 2022 episode entitled How to Keep House While Drowning With DomesticBlisters\nRight off the bat, she does away with the word “chores”. Chores are boring things that you need to do just because you’re expected to. Let’s forget about chores and focus on care tasks instead. Care tasks are entirely functional. You do them because doing them is required to make the spaces you inhabit function for you. You do them to care for yourself and your loved ones. And if doing them is not functional for you, if they don’t add anything you value to your life—you don’t need to do them!3\nAn example: If you have kids (and, let’s face it, even if you don’t), it can be difficult to have a pristine kitchen at any point. Dishes might pile up; counters may get soiled chaotically from little baking projects and snacks and spillages; fruit may be partially rotting somewhere; and when’s the last time you dusted in between that cupboard and the other thing? Well, perhaps the goal of completely cleaning your kitchen and keeping it that way forever is a tad unrealistic, dearie.\nPerhaps you just internalized that a good mother, husband, carer, however-you-identify should maintain a clean kitchen at all times, otherwise you are failing your family, your gender—heck—your nation4.\nPoppycock.\nWhat matters is if the kitchen functions for you and your household. Are important surfaces sanitized or potentially contaminated? Is there some space in the sink in case someone needs to wash something? Is fresh fruit visible and easy to access for those seeking a healthy snack? Forget what someone whose opinion is irrelevant might think you should be doing to your kitchen. What do you need for it to be functional?\nThis is step 0. The most important step comes next: approaching all this without judgment. Without assuming that the way you take care of your spaces defines your value as a person. Without feeling shame for liberating yourself from what is, in fact, not important to you. Without beating yourself up for not completing care tasks that are important, even though you meant to. Because if the whole point is caring, shaming yourself for failing is going to accomplish what, exactly? Instead, try to talk to yourself as you would to a dear friend in distress. Console yourself, remind yourself that you are doing what you can and it’s ok, consider reaching out for help—all those things that are easier said than done, and nevertheless worth practicing.\nOf course, figuring out what is functional for you and letting go of the shame is neither easy nor does it solve everything. If you still struggle to do tasks that are important to you, don’t despair. So do I. There are dozens of us, DOZENS!5 Perhaps one of KC’s many videos will be helpful to you, or you can consult her very accessible book. Oh, look, a resources list right below. How convenient!\n\nResources\n\nListen to KC on Infinite Quest (Spotify link): How to Keep House While Drowning With DomesticBlisters\nWatch KC on TikTok: DomesticBlisters\nFind similar content on her Instagram: strugglecare\nRead KC’s book: How to Keep House While Drowning: A Gentle Approach to Cleaning and Organizing\nCheck out KC’s own Resources Page on her website\n\n\n\nBonus\nYou’re still here? I’m flattered.\nFor real, though, I believe this concept has the potential to be extended to other areas of life where you might be holding on to unnecessary and dysfunctional expectations. Think of all the things you believe you’re supposed to do in order to lead a better, purer life. Perhaps they include such classics as Wake Up Earlier, Read More Fiction, or Eat Fewer Chips. Many people try to tell you those are noble pursuits to be ignored at one’s own risk. Well, those people don’t know what’s good for you. And, to be frank, they probably don’t know what’s good for themselves either. Don’t take their advice; eject it from your mind. Then fill the space back with things that you actually have good reason to believe would make you happier. Maybe they’re even the same things! But they’ll taste different this way :)\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nLongtime fans will recognize this as a form of introjected regulation, a kind of external regulation within Self-Determination Theory that I described in a past life.↩︎\nOf course, it’s never just one thing, but that’s a minor detail.↩︎\nPro-tip from Catieosaurus: If you hate folding laundry.

    "text": "I used to think fat bodies were inherently less healthy than thin bodies. I believed that fighting “obesity” at a societal and individual level was important. I also felt superior to fat people for having a thin body. Now, this makes me feel ashamed.\nMy mind was changed by listening to fat people1 who have done extensive research, and then going into the literature myself for hours. What I found was deeply troubling and compelled me to share it with you. Perhaps this will help you, as it has helped me, overcome the anti-fatness we’ve inherited and start working to dismantle it. If you don’t care about some thin guy’s thoughts on anti-fatness and “obesity” research, consider skipping straight to the Resources section and use the suggestions as a springboard for further education."

    "section": "Myth 1: It is proven that having a fat body is inherently unhealthy.",
    "text": "Myth 1: It is proven that having a fat body is inherently unhealthy.\nThis is simply imagined. There is no consensus at all in the literature, even though they’ve been trying for decades. Large studies find a protection against mortality for those who are slightly “overweight”, and a rise in mortality for those who are very thin or very fat2. Others say “no, that can’t be!!” and adjust analyses until they find what they are looking for. Check this, from a recent critique of meta-analyses of cohort studies3, emphasis mine:\n\nKarahalios and colleagues’ meta-analysis is the first to show that weight loss and weight gain in midlife are associated with increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality, and weakly associated with cancer mortality. They discussed weight loss intention, effect modification, reverse causation, bias and confounding, and stated that ‘this is the highest level of evidence possible’ and ‘these observational data suggest weight stability from middle age [is beneficial], however, further research investigating effect modification by obesity status is warranted.’\nAlthough the authors did not recommend weight stability regardless of health and weight status, the results based on observational data could be easily misinterpreted, with adverse public health implications. Our interpretation is that their result that weight gain showed higher risk than weight stability is plausible and confirms that increased adiposity is harmful. Such increased risk can be more easily observed when obesity has been rapidly increasing globally during the follow-up period of the cohorts, and we would expect more unhealthy weight gain and related harms than healthy weight reduction and related benefits in many cohort studies. However, their finding that weight reduction is associated with high mortality risk is unexpected and more problematic. It is most likely due to reverse causation, as the adverse effects of unintentional weight loss due to ill health and ageing in many participants would overwhelm any benefits of weight loss in the few attempting it intentionally.\n\nDid you catch it? This is such a common pattern in the literature that I’m honestly angry. Any evidence that weight gain is harmful is obvious and good; any evidence that weight loss is problematic is probably hopelessly confounded by many factors the researchers didn’t consider, and also too few people attempt to lose weight anyway (are you shitting me?). Take a look in the fucking research mirror.\nBut, OK, let’s imagine (it’s easy, doctors do it!) that there is a robust association between higher weight and higher risk of disease. You cannot then conclude that fat itself causes worse health outcomes, especially given the very strong evidence we have for a significant confounding factor: anti-fatness. Anti-fatness causes stress (from strangers giving you looks, telling you that your body is wrong, policing your food choices since childhood); it causes attempts to diet, which often result in losing weight, gaining it back, and trying to lose it again (called weight cycling or “yo-yo dieting”); it causes decreased access to medical care, because doctors refuse treatment or are so judgemental that you postpone a visit despite symptoms. Sounds important; doesn’t get measured. \nAnother obvious confounder is behavior. We know that getting regular exercise, eating vegetables, and many other behaviors can have a very positive impact on your health. Could it be that the heavier people in your sample also show fewer of these positive behaviors, and it’s the behaviors that are driving the difference in health outcomes? Without ruling out confounders, it’s irresponsible and unethical to extrapolate that recommending weight loss is a good thing. The thing is, you barely see studies applying this level of skepticism and looking for other causes when they document an association between fatness and health, but you do see those same studies saying that we should keep recommending weight loss.\nTo make it crystal clear: If you find data showing that tall people have higher salaries than shorter people in the same white-collar jobs, do you immediately conclude that height causes intelligence and job performance? If you see a racial minority perform worse in school than the non-minoritized children, do you make strong inferences about race-based differences in intelligence? No.\nAnd yet, “obesity” researchers and health care providers repeatedly do this when it comes to weight and health, ignoring alternative explanations in favor of a dogmatic focus on weight loss. This should be reason enough to be suspicious of the whole thing. Especially since there are bagillions of dollars to be made in convincing people that weight loss is necessary.\nBut let’s move on. Imagine that it were proven, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that higher amounts of fat lead to worse health outcomes. Imagine (again, the healthcare system does this all the time, you can too!) that we have super solid evidence that it is the fat itself that causes increased risk of certain diseases (reminder: we definitely do not). Then what?\nTell people to lose weight, right?"

    "text": "Myth 2: People can permanently lose a significant amount of weight and keep it off if they want to.\nThis is the most outrageous, because there are so. many. studies on this.\nDoctors and pharma companies keep trying to prove that one diet or another, one “treatment” or another, can lead to sustained weight loss, and they just can’t. The proportion of people who manage to lose weight and keep it off for over two years is eclipsed by the number of people who end up at the same weight or higher. Within five years, it’s basically zero. All these people were subjected to health harms (fast weight loss, weight cycling), potentially developing disordered eating or an eating disorder as a result, and for what?\nBy the way, these are MEDICALLY SUPERVISED DIETS. Randomized studies, where some people received a diet and others didn’t; or some received a drug and others a placebo. This is not based on people randomly going “hmm, guess I’ll try intermittent fasting” and switching back to their normal patterns after a few weeks. But we do kind of have data on that, too!\nOne study took data from around 170,000 “obese” people and followed them for several years. They received no intervention for this study, they were just observed to see how many achieved a weight considered “normal” for their height. Of those classified as “Class 1 obese”, the annual probability of achieving a “normal” weight was 1 in 210 for men and 1 in 124 for women. 0.4 and 0.8 percent, respectively. And for those in the “Class 3 obesity” category: 1 in 1,290 for men and 1 in 677 for women. Do you realize how low that is? Do you believe this is because none of those people wanted to and tried (probably multiple times) to lose weight? Do you think no doctor ever told them “you just need to lose some weight” when they came in with unrelated complaints? That no friend ever suggested that they order the salad instead of whatever they ordered?"

Then we could know if it actually had a positive health impact, independent of health markers such as the lipid profile. But we can’t, so we don’t really know.4\nAnd yet we act as if this is simply established fact. Of COURSE you should diet and try to lose weight if you’re above your “ideal weight”. Even if you then gain the weight back, who cares! It was good for you to have it off for a couple of months. Ugghhhhh.\nAnd it gets worse! I have tried to find studies that show weight loss maintenance after 2 years, and the literature seems pretty sure that it generally doesn’t happen. However, it is true that some people manage to lose weight before gaining it back. When this happens, sometimes researchers try to test whether this weight loss led to some meaningful outcome (e.g., fewer people becoming diabetic) despite the fact that people regain the weight eventually. If so, jackpot! No need to test for the obvious confounder—whether people ate better and exercised more in this period and whether THAT is associated with a protective effect—since we already showed what we came here for (any weight loss, even if short lived, protects you against disease!). It’s almost as if there are enormous amounts of money to be made from people pursuing weight loss all their lives… but we don’t want to be conspiracy theorists. Of course it could also be due to medical researchers’ profound lack of statistical and causal inference education. But we don’t want to go around proposing obvious confounders unnecessarily, right?\nFUUUUCK. MEE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus myth: You can judge a person's health by looking at their current size.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. The fat person you are judging could be at the peak of their health. The thin person you are congratulating could have just lost weight due to depression. The friend who gained a few kilos recently may finally be progressing on their mental health treatment and started taking antidepressants as prescribed. The friend who lost weight when they started exercising will probably gain it back, even if they keep exercising—yet they're still healthier than if they didn't exercise. The fat person you are congratulating for slimming down could be showing signs of an eating disorder that no one picks up on because we assume that any weight a fat person loses was for the best, even if they stopped menstruating months ago."

Have you ever commented on someone’s food choices, shamed them for not eating enough salad or whatever you thought was best for them, because they looked too fat to you? Have you ever suggested a specific diet to someone based on their looks? Then, unfortunately, you’ve done a horrible thing. Truly. You have contributed to someone’s internalized anti-fatness, have raised their chances of developing disordered eating, have perpetuated harmful lies that allow society to keep oppressing fat people.

Listen to one podcast episode about fatness BY A FAT PERSON; read one article about fatness BY A FAT PERSON; buy and read one of the several books Aubrey Gordon has written or recommends; follow one fat activist on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, whatever. And if you find yourself having quick, knee-jerk reactions when they explain things to you, remember to shut up and I mean take the time to listen. Then go process things for a month or two.

It’s so pervasive, so unconscious, we don’t even consider it, but spontaneously congratulating someone for looking thinner is perpetuating harm. This harm comes in many forms, but let me quote you something that really touched me recently7:\n\n\nThe thing for me, in terms of my weight and my mental health, is that, when I’ve been smallest (…) it’s usually when I’ve been the most unwell, and ironically when everyone’s been the most happy and pleased with me. (…) I remember one time (…) a vicar, actually, came up to me and he said, “Tanya you look marvelous! Tell me, what is your secret?” And I said, “Severe depression and staying in bed for two weeks.”\n\n\nStop encouraging weight loss. You’re not a doctor—it’s enough (too much, really) that they already deny patients care and humanity because of anti-fatness. Don’t spontaneously suggest other people should lose weight, or encourage them to go on this or that diet.\nStop supporting the “fight against obesity”. For example, at work: remove weight loss as an explicit goal of wellness programs (if they must exist at all); challenge your organization if you ever start projects with the explicit goal of “fighting obesity”.\nStop equating morality to body size. EVEN IF people were fat only because they lack the willpower to eat healthy and exercise (which is categorically not true), that has nothing to do with whether they are a good person, deserving of love and compassion. Do you consider it immoral to be depressed and not be able to get out of bed? To try and fail at quitting smoking? To need accommodations for being too short or too tall? Do you think it’s useful to shame any of these groups of people for how they are, in the hopes that they will change?\nStop equating health to body size, and start actually caring about the health of your loved ones. To participate in their health, ask: How are you feeling? Are you stressed? Do you sleep well? Do you manage to move, at least a bit each day? Do you manage to eat fruits and vegetables every day? If not, can I help you with any of these things? Do you have pain that you’re finding hard to manage? OK, maybe not everything at once, chill out.\nStart realizing that fast weight loss is a cause for concern. Let me quote you from The Fat Doctor Podcast again, to drive this point home. Dr Asher Larmie8:\n\n\nAnd during that time, mum was (...) going to salsa classes and enjoying herself and having the time of her life and she was so happy because she was finally losing weight. And she was just, she was rejoicing about it (…) Do you remember that time when she was like, “Girls, girls, look!” And she pulled her trousers down and she didn’t have to unbutton her jeans anymore, they just slid down because she had lost so much weight around her bottom. I remember very distinctly that she had mentioned around Christmas time (...) that she was getting some stomach pains and, you know, “that’s really weird isn’t it?” And I said, “Oh it is a bit weird, mum, why don’t you try some indigestion medication and if it doesn’t get any better, you know, let me know,” and then stuff happened (...) And then we got to February and I came over with the kids and (…) I walked into the house, Junior was with me (...) and mum didn’t look like herself, and I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, and all of a sudden, Junior sort of pulled me to one side and said, “Babes, look at your mum.” And I said, “What about her?” And he said, “Look at you mum, she’s jaundiced! She’s yellow!” And then I looked over at mum and I suddenly thought, “Oh. Yeah. She’s yellow. That’s not good.” And that was mid February, and by March we’d had the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, and she died in July, and I… I guess she was so happy about the fact that she lost weight, that her own daughter, a GP, a doctor, (...) did not put two and two together and think “weight loss and abdominal pain in a woman in her 60s is never a good thing, she NEEDS to see a doctor”.\n\n\nStart looking out for fat oppression around you, and considering ways that you personally could help end it. The resources below will help with this. One last (promise!) inspirational quote for you:\n\n\nSometimes, too, our power may not be clear to us. Each of us may forget the influence that we have over those we know and love. We may also forget that we’ve developed a sharp skill set for shifting the thinking and actions of those closest to us. Those working or learning in schools may not realize they can request more accessible seating options for fat and disabled students and faculty. Those in workplaces with human resources departments can advocate for the end of anti-fat “workplace wellness” programs, or workplace “biggest loser” weight-loss competitions. Health-care providers and administrators can make sure that medical equipment like blood pressure cuffs and exam tables are built for fat bodies, and start difficult, vital conversations about tackling anti-fat bias in health care. And nearly all of us can do more to interrupt vicious anti-fatness when it rears its head in public. None of these actions in and of themselves will end anti-fatness, but they can help stem the tide of anti-fatness that fat people contend with every day. Take these opportunities for action as footholds, options for next steps in your work to support fat people[…].9\n\nI used to think we should fight “obesity”. Maybe you did too. I am now convinced that we’ll all be better off if we focus on health, not weight, and on fighting anti-fatness, not “obesity”. And you?"

Weak sense of justice\nNormal nervous systems are strongly affected by injustice. People with NSD have an underdeveloped sense of justice and morality, perhaps due to their empathy deficits. They seem to lack the normal reaction to witnessing embarrassment, not showing any signs of physical pain or an anxious emotional state when watching scenes in which a character is humiliated, for example. At times, the lack of empathy is such that they laugh instead of feeling the appropriate emotions.

    "text": "This post is an adaptation / archive of something I first wrote for Instagram (link to original post). The images are reposted in order with respective image descriptions.\nTikTok account @myfavouritejo (also on Instagram @myfavouritejo) asks: what if neurodivergence was the norm? Highly inspired by their content, I made this post to subvert how we generally conceive of Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder. If 95% of people were like that, would we create a diagnosis of “Neurotypical Spectrum Disorder”? What other characteristics come to mind?\n\n\n\nImage text:\nHow to Spot a Neurotypical - 5 Signs of Neurotypical Spectrum Disroder\n(POV: ADHD* is the norm)\n*Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\n\n\n\n\n\nImage text:\n1. Lack of concentration\nNeurotypicals lack the normal ability to focus for hours and days on tasks that interest them. Often, they need to break up large goals into smaller steps that can be accomplished over weeks. This different kind of attention, also called “hypofocus”, allows them to pay attention to fewer things, with less intensity, but over a longer period of time (days, weeks, months, even), which is why some people with NSD consider hypofocus a “superpower”.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage text:\n2. Restricted interests\nIt’s common for neurotypicals to have just a few interests over the course of their adult lives. Even the few interests they have, they must enjoy moderately, lacking the normal intensity. Neurotypicals seem to prefer not to engage with their hobbies more than once or twice a week. Although this tendency hinders the normal development of a wide breadth of knowledge over the lifespan, people with NSD can compensate for this deficit by developing mastery in one or two domains.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage text:\n3. Slow learning rate\nNeurotypicals find it difficult to learn about topics that interest them with the speed that normal people are used to. They prefer structured, slow (think weeks, not days), guided learning to learn the same amount that a normal person could over a single weekend. If your neurotypical friend mentioned that they started learning how to crochet, don’t expect to receive a sweater any time soon. Be patient, they’ll get there, eventually.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage text:\n4. Atypical conversation patterns\nLikely due to information processing difficulties, neurotypical people tend to speak slowly, in a monotone, without using speech modulation (changing the speed and volume of speech, using varied accents, making random sounds) to have fun, express their enthusiasm, or express themselves more richly. They tend to only tell one story at a time, very linearly, prioritizing simplicity and depriving their conversation partners of highly interesting tangents.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage text:\n5. Low creativity\nPeople with Neurotypical Spectrum Disorder, despite saying they value creativity, suffer from a highly limiting belief: they believe in a “box” inside of which thinking occurs, and which contains a very limited number of options. They associate great discomfort with what they call “thinking outside of the box”, meaning that their belief in this invisible box, irrational as it is, has real consequences, restricting the ways they think and act in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage text:\nPeople with adhd live in a world designed by and for neurotypical people.\n\nTo navigate the world, they must learn how others act and pretend to be like them.\n\nWhat if neurotypicals learned more about adhd? what if we created a world that accommodates neurodiversity?\n\n\nNote: Colors are from this color palette, from Almodóvar’s Pain and Glory: https://www.kwanyuanliu.com/post/pain-glory-colors\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{brazão2023,\n  author = {Vasco Brazão},\n  title = {What If {ADHD} Was the Norm?},\n  date = {2023-02-21},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nVasco Brazão. 2023. “What If ADHD Was the Norm?” February\n21, 2023."
