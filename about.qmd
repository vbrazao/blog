Hi! I'm Vasco, an applied statistician from Lisbon. My academic background and specialest interest is psychology, but there's lots more I enjoy learning, thinking, and writing (about) --- poetry, neurodiversity, science, social justice, and, of course, stats and math. Some of that will appear on this blog, so stick around if you like :)
